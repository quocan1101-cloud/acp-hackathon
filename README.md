# Yield Finder â€” Buyer/Seller Agent Demo

This project implements a **buyerâ€“seller agent system** using the [Virtuals ACP](https://virtuals.io) framework.  
The goal is to demonstrate autonomous **yield-finding services**: a buyer agent requests the best yield opportunities, and a seller agent fulfills the request by aggregating providers (e.g., Beefy, Yearn).
